  <p>Vancouver is considered one of the top five cities for quality of life.
    And that’s for good reason. With trees that were donated from Japan to the
    “Canada Place”, it’s got you covered in landscape. Care to drop buy because you like movies?
    Vancouver is considered “Hollywood North” because of the amount of movies filmed here. I could keep going on,
    but it’d be easier for you to come visit yourself!
